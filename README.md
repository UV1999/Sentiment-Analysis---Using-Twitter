# Sentiment-Analysis - Using-Twitter
My new repository for sentiment analysis using Twitter tweets.
We all know about Twitter and use it everyday. Millions of data is collected through tweets by all the users and these tweets are almost on any topic in the whole world. Everyone have different opinions, suggestions and feelings about different topics. Basically, Twitter is a big psychological database with many psychologists ( Pun intended ! ).
In this post, i will extract data from Twitter and perform sentiment analysis using pandas, tweepy and vaderSentiment libraries for Python. This requires Twitter's API and create an application in Twitter developers using the link below :
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create
pandas- pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
tweepy- An easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
vaderSentiment- VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.
